Hi, <br>
In this Post I am going to write about my workflow and how I organize myself with [Obsidian](Obsidian.md)

### What is Obsidian?
Obsidian is a note taking tool. The Website states, "your second brain". This explains what Obsidian is all about.<br>
Our brain works, by linking all the information we have to store with each other.(I am no Neurologist,that's all I can give you). If I learn something about Physics for example Waves my brain will link that with waves on the ocean. If I think about waves I imagine the waves on the ocean. <br>
Obsidian works just like that. My Obsidian Vault(Just a folder where you store all your Data), are a lot of files, that are linked to each other.
